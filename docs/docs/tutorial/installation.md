# Installation

The purpose of this guide is to help you install `TypeStream` locally so you can
start writing your own data pipelines.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

We use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run `TypeStream`
dependencies.

## Install

If you have brew:

```bash
brew install typestreamio/tap/typestream
```

Then check if `TypeStream` is installed correctly:

```bash
typestream --version
typestream version 0.0.1
```

If you see the version number, then you're ready to go ðŸš€

## Where to go from here

If it's the first time you're around here, we recommend the [getting
started](/docs/getting-started.md) guide.
