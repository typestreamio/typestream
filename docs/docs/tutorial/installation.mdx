# Installation

The purpose of this guide is to help you install `TypeStream` locally so you can
start writing your own data pipelines.

If you're looking to run `TypeStream` in production, refer to the
[deployment](/tutorial/deployment.md) guide.

`TypeStream` can run in two different modes:

- [Local mode](#local-mode): This mode is intended for development purposes.
  Every feature is available, but long running processes aren't persisted
  anywhere. It's **not** recommended to use local mode in production.
- [Kubernetes mode](#kubernetes-mode): This mode is intended for production
  purposes. Every feature is available and long running processes are run as
  Kubernetes jobs. It's the recommended way to run `TypeStream` in production.

To help you install `TypeStream`, the official CLI has two groups of commands to
help you with the process of installing `TypeStream` locally. So let's install
the CLI first:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Brew" label="Brew" default>

```bash
brew install typestreamio/tap/typestream
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="choco" label="Choco">

```bash
# TODO
```

See the issue [notes for future windows
setup](https://github.com/typestreamio/typestream/issues/74) for more
information about installing TypeStream on Windows.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then check if `TypeStream` is installed correctly:

```bash
typestream --version
typestream version 2023.09.28.0
```

If you see something like that, you're all set ðŸŽ‰

## Local mode

Pre-requisites:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

import LocalStart from "./_local_start.mdx";

<LocalStart />

If you have an existing docker compose file, you can add a `typestream` service
to it. Run `typestream local show` to get the docker compose snippet you need to
add to your existing docker compose file.

## Kubernetes mode

Pre-requisites:

- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

The first thing we need to do know is to create a cluster minikube:

```bash
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --addons=registry --profile=typestream --insecure-registry="10.0.0.0/24"
```

Then install `TypeStream`:

```bash
typestream k8s create --redpanda
```

This command installs `TypeStream` in the `typestream` namespace. You can
check if everything is installed correctly by running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n typestream
```

If you see something like this:

```bash
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

replicaset.apps/server-5d97446fd8     1         1         1       87s
```

You're all set now ðŸŽ‰
