# Getting Started

TypeStream is a streaming data platform that compiles pipeline definitions into Kafka Streams topologies. You can build pipelines three ways: an **interactive CLI** with Unix-style syntax, **config-as-code** with `.typestream.json` files, or a **visual GUI** with drag-and-drop.

All three converge on the same execution engine -- pick the one that fits your workflow.

## Quick setup

Install the CLI and start the local environment:

```bash
brew install typestreamio/tap/typestream
typestream local dev start
```

Then seed sample data:

```bash
typestream local seed
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [installation](installation.mdx) page.

## Your first pipeline: filter a stream

Let's filter a books topic to find a specific title. Here's the same pipeline built three ways.

### CLI (interactive shell)

Start the TypeStream shell:

```bash
typestream
```

Then run:

```sh
grep /dev/kafka/local/topics/books "Station Eleven"
```

Output:

```json
{"id":"b1fb542c-...","title":"Station Eleven","word_count":"300","author_id":"386428f9-..."}
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop (streaming pipelines run until cancelled).

To write the filtered results to a new topic:

```sh
grep /dev/kafka/local/topics/books "Station Eleven" > /dev/kafka/local/topics/station_eleven
```

### Config-as-code

Create a file called `filter-books.typestream.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "filter-books",
  "version": "1",
  "description": "Filter books by title",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "source-1",
        "streamSource": {
          "dataStream": { "path": "/dev/kafka/local/topics/books" },
          "encoding": "AVRO"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "filter-1",
        "filter": {
          "predicate": { "expr": ".title ~= \"Station Eleven\"" }
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "sink-1",
        "sink": {
          "output": { "path": "/dev/kafka/local/topics/station_eleven" }
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      { "fromId": "source-1", "toId": "filter-1" },
      { "fromId": "filter-1", "toId": "sink-1" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Preview what will happen:

```bash
typestream plan filter-books.typestream.json
```

Apply the pipeline:

```bash
typestream apply filter-books.typestream.json
```

### Visual GUI

Open the TypeStream UI at `http://localhost:5173`, navigate to the graph builder, and:

1. Drag a **Kafka Source** node onto the canvas and select the `books` topic
2. Drag a **Filter** node and connect it to the source, then set the predicate to `.title ~= "Station Eleven"`
3. Drag a **Kafka Sink** node and connect it to the filter, then set the output topic
4. Click **Create Job**
