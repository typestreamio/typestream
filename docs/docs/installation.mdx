# Installation

This guide covers installing the TypeStream CLI and starting a local development environment.

## Install the CLI

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="Homebrew" default>

```bash
brew install typestreamio/tap/typestream
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation:

```bash
typestream --version
```

## Prerequisites

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed to run TypeStream locally.

## Start the local environment

TypeStream ships with a `local` command group that manages a full Docker Compose stack: Redpanda (Kafka-compatible broker), Schema Registry, Envoy proxy, and the TypeStream server.

### Production mode

Run the full stack (server inside Docker):

```bash
typestream local start
```

You should see:

```
INFO 🚀 starting TypeStream server
INFO 🛫 starting server
INFO 🛫 starting redpanda
INFO ✨ redpanda started
INFO ✨ server started
INFO ✅ server healthy
INFO ✅ redpanda healthy
INFO 🎉 TypeStream server started
```

### Development mode

If you're developing on the server itself, use dev mode. This starts only the infrastructure services -- you run the server on your host for hot reload:

```bash
typestream local dev
```

Then start the server separately:

```bash
./scripts/dev/server.sh
```

## Demo data

Demo data generators start automatically with the local environment. After a few seconds, verify the topics are available:

```bash
echo 'ls /dev/kafka/local/topics' | typestream
```

You should see topics like `web_visits`, `crypto_tickers`, `wikipedia_changes`, and `_schema`.

## Stop the environment

```bash
typestream local stop
```

To stop and remove all volumes (clean slate):

```bash
typestream local dev clean
```

## Configuration

TypeStream is configured via a `typestream.toml` file. At startup, the server looks for this file using the `TYPESTREAM_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, then falls back to the current directory and `/etc/typestream`.

Default configuration:

```toml
[grpc]
port = 4242

[sources.kafka.local]
bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092"
schemaRegistry.url = "http://localhost:8081"
fsRefreshRate = 60
```

See the [configuration reference](reference/configuration.md) for all options.
