# Git Workflow

## Branch/PR for Major Work
All significant development MUST happen on a feature branch with a PR:
- New features, node types, or commands
- Refactors touching multiple files
- Proto changes (affect server, CLI, and UI stubs)
- Any work spanning more than a handful of lines

Workflow:
1. Create a branch from main: `git checkout -b <descriptive-name>`
2. Make commits on the branch
3. Push and create a PR with `gh pr create`
4. Merge via GitHub after review

## Direct Commits to Main
Only for quick, low-risk fixes:
- Typo fixes in docs or code
- Single-line bug fixes with obvious correctness
- Config tweaks (e.g. docker-compose ports, dev scripts)
- Memory/rules file updates

When in doubt, use a branch.
